 <div> "I’ve really enjoyed all the activities we’ve been doing,
      and the constant offer/support of help from all the instructors!The camp has been awesome. 
      There’s been so much I’ve enjoyed here, from all the fun activities,
       to all the help the instructors offer! I’ve also really enjoyed meeting so many new people,
        and having the opportunity to work in different groups almost all the time :)"- Dia</P>

        <p> "This camp introduced me into the world of coding and further developed my understanding of the internet.
             The knowledge that I gained from this camp can be used in various different fields
              that I could pursue in the future. One of my favorite parts was the implementation of bootstrap into css stylisation.
               I believe that this camp is great for people to take as it can help them understand things that can easily be taken for granted"-Ryan . </p>

          "I enjoyed being able to learn new things and see what I wrote in code appear on my web page.
          I especially enjoyed Javascript because of all the interesting concepts like variables, arrays, and so on.
           Overall, the instructors and peers in the camp made it a fun experience".- Alexander </p>

           <p>" I enjoyed being here, The first week was a little rough but I pulled through.
               My favourite part of being here is meeting new people, making new friends and mister Mikes jokes.
            It was really nice to be here and I enjoyed learning something new".- Daneiell   </p>
