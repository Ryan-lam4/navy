The knowledge that I gained from this camp can be used in various different fields that I could pursue in the future. One of my favorite parts was the implementation of bootstrap into css stylisation. I believe that this camp is great for people to take as it can help them understand things that can easily be taken for granted"-Ryan . </p></div>
